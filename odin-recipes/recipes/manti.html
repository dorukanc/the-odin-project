    <p>Kayseri Manti is a traditional Turkish dish consisting of small dumplings filled with spiced meat, typically served with a garlic yogurt sauce and a drizzle of melted butter infused with sumac.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water (more if needed)</li>
        <li>200g ground beef or lamb</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sumac (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Gradually add water and knead until you form a smooth dough. Cover and let it rest for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, mix the ground meat, chopped onion, cumin, salt, and pepper until well combined.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough on a floured surface until it's very thin, about 1/16 inch thick. Cut the dough into small squares, approximately 1.5 inches on each side.</li>
        <li>Place a small amount of the meat mixture in the center of each square. Fold the dough over to form a triangle or rectangle, and press the edges to seal. You can also bring the corners together to form a small pouch.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the manti and cook for about 8-10 minutes, or until they float to the surface and are cooked through. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix the yogurt with the minced garlic. Season with a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, remove from heat and stir in the sumac if using.</li>
        <li>To serve, place the cooked manti on a plate, drizzle with the garlic yogurt sauce, and then pour the melted butter over the top.</li>
        <li>Garnish with additional sumac or chopped parsley if desired. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
