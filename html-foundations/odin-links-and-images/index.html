    <p> this link opens in a new tab, use rel="noopener noreferrer" for security reasons

    <h2>notes about links</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>noopener prevents the new page from being able to access the window.opener property and ensures it runs in a separate process.</li>
        <li>noreferrer has the same effect as noopener but also prevents the Referer header from being sent to the new page.</li>
        <li>so noreferrer has both security and privacy benefits</li>
    </ul>
